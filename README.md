# Bat Bots
Bat Bots is a multiplayer arcade-style shooter. You play as a security guard tasked with guarding a cybernetics facility and when the latest prototype of robotic bats get loose, it's up to you to bring them back! Our game hopes to recreate the experience found in some older games of a similar genre, taking inspiration from one of the hit games of the 1980â€™s, Duck Hunt while adding new twists like cooperative multiplayer.
