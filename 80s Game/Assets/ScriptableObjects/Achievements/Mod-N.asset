    reactors, an internal generator composed of tightly-nested gyroscopic dynamos
    has been developed. This device, which has been named the \u201CPowerCore,\u201D
    also doubles as a self-contained data storage and processing unit. While its
    design requires a sizable frame to accommodate it, the PowerCore\u2019s incredible
    utility will aid the development of more varied models in the future.\r"
