  descriptionText: "[Email from the Finance Director to the Laboratory Director]\r\nThe
    development of the electromagnetic pulse resonator seems like an ill-advised
    plan. Not only is the cost of manufacturing a single one extremely prohibitive,
    but its operation is all but guaranteed to render all units caught in its radius
    irreparable. Why are we spending resources on technology that is so hazardous
    to our own research materials?\r"
