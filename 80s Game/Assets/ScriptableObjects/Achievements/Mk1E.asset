    it is unfortunate that the stability of the behavioral module has regressed below
    the standards, the development of the new flight controller is critical to contribute
    to the research this program was established to fulfill. Failure to take risks
    often leads to failures in innovation and we must strive to excel even in the
    face of uncertainty.\r"
