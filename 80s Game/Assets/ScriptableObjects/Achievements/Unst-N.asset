    a failsafe system is required to ensure that units can be returned should an
    unexpected event occur. To this end, we are in the process of developing a leader
    unit that dictates the behavior of other bats in its vicinity. To easily distinguish
    them in the field, Aesthetics & Design have given them a fluorescent yellow coat.\r"
