  descriptionText: "[Excerpt from a memo to the Program Director]\r\nThe containment
    field resonator has been installed in the bat housing facility. The frequency
    emitted by the resonator interferes with the bats\u2019 navigation systems, so
    it should keep them from escaping the compound if they somehow breach containment.
    However, the crystal components of the device are extremely fragile and care
    should be taken to prevent damage to them. Are there plans to invest in more
    durable containment technology?\r"
